/* Data types: number, string,  boolean etc
Number: can be positive, negative, whole. decimal
Strings: Are charaters between quotes eg: 'Dorothy' or "Dorothy"
Boolean: These values can be true or false ( no quotes required)

Variable: A named container for some value

1. Variable declaration: Using keyword "let"
Eg: let myscore;( Use semicolon to end/terminate the statement)
2. Variable Assignment: Most of the time you declare a variable and assign a value at the same time.
Eg: let myscore=1100; ( first time you assign a value it is called initializing a variable)
3. Variable Reassignment: To reassign the value to variable, use varibale name, the assignment operator and a new value - do not use keyword "let" again
Eg: 
let myscore=1100; ( Variable assignment )
myscore=1101; ( Variable re-assignment)
4. Variable declaration: Const: You may use const keyword
Eg: const playerName='Kumar'
Note: You must intialize the const when you declare it i.e. const playerName; ( this is not allowed) neither can you reassign the value 
i.e. playerName=Newkumar( this is not allowed either)
General knowledge: let, const keywords were introduced into ES6 only in 2015. Before that it had only one keyword for variables i.e. 'var'
Point being: YOU WILL OFTEN RUN INTO 'VAR' IN OLDER CODE
5. null keyword: empty/non-existent value, intentional absence of value
6. undefined keyword: value given to varibles that are declared but not intialized yet e.g: let x ( FUnctions can return undefined values)
